/**
 * Abstract Base class file buffer object allows for easy buffered file input
 * and output. This object, and its two concrete derived classes
 * (FileInputBuffer and FileOutputBuffer) are used when large amounts of binary
 * data must be written and read efficiently to and from disk.
 * 
 * The derived classes maintain a byte[] array that is used to read and write
 * data into and out of using a standard DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
 * Java object. In input mode the buffer is filled directly from disk using a
 * single read where the byte count is fixed to some number less than or equal
 * to all file bytes. In output mode the buffer is written directly to disk and
 * then refilled to be written again if necessary.
 *
 * See the derived concrete classes for an interface description
